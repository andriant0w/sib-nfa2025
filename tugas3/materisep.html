    <h1>Software Engineering Principles</h1>
    <p>Software engineering principles are guidelines that help developers create high-quality software. These principles aim to improve the efficiency, maintainability, and scalability of software systems.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> The practice of dividing a software system into distinct, manageable modules, each responsible for a specific functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> The process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object or system.</li>
        <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The principle of bundling the data and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.</li>
        <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> The practice of organizing code into distinct sections, each addressing a separate concern or functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Singleton:</strong> A design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance.</li>
        <li><strong>Factory Method:</strong> A design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.</li>
        <li><strong>Observer:</strong> A design pattern where an object, known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them of any state changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Decorator:</strong> A design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.</li>
        <li>Follow coding standards and conventions.</li>
        <li>Use version control systems to manage code changes.</li>
        <li>Regularly refactor code to improve its structure and readability.</li>
        <li>Write unit tests to ensure code correctness and reliability.</li>
    </ul>
