    <h1>DevOps & Deployment</h1>
    <p>DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Continuous Integration (CI):</strong> The practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Delivery (CD):</strong> A software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC):</strong> The process of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Version Control Systems:</strong> Tools like Git that help manage changes to source code over time.</li>
        <li><strong>CI/CD Pipelines:</strong> Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and CircleCI that automate the process of integration and delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Containerization:</strong> Technologies like Docker that package an application and its dependencies into a container that can run on any computing environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Tools like Kubernetes that automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Deployment Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blue-Green Deployment:</strong> A technique that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments, only one of which serves live production traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Canary Deployment:</strong> A technique to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users before making it available to everybody.</li>
        <li><strong>Rolling Deployment:</strong> A technique where new software versions are gradually rolled out to replace the old versions without downtime.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Automate everything from code integration to deployment.</li>
        <li>Monitor and log everything to ensure visibility and traceability.</li>
        <li>Implement security practices throughout the development and deployment process.</li>
        <li>Regularly test and validate your deployment processes.</li>
    </ul>
